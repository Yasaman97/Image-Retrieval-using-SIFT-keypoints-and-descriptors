# Image Retrieval using SIFT keypoints and descriptors
 
## About

Using sift feature detector, compute the keypoints and descriptors of an image, then by changing the threshold we test the ability to find the image from the dataset. The same image itself can always be found in the dataset, as it would have the lowest distance measure.
